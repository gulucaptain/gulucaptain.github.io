I’m a second-year Ph.D. student in the School of Computer Science at Fudan University, supervised by Prof. Zuxuan Wu and Prof. Yu-Gang Jiang. Before that, I received my Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Computer Science from Nanchang University in 2019 and 2022, respectively.

My research interests lie in computer vision and deep learning, with an emphasis on video understanding and generation, e.g., crowd counting, video-language retrieval, general video generation, and customized video generation.
