I'm a second-year Ph.D. student in the School of Computer Science at Fudan University, supervised by Prof. Zuxuan Wu and Prof. Yu-Gang Jiang.

My research interests lie in computer vision and deep learning, with an emphasis on video understanding and generation, e.g., crowd counting, video-language retrieval, general video generation, and customized video generation.

Publication
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.
